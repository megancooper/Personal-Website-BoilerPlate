				<h1 align="center">Who Am I?</h1>
				<p>Currently a student at UT Austin, I enjoy programming and 
					having fun. As a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering 
					student and the University of Texas at Austin, I have already 
					had hands on experience with C, C++, and Assemblyâ€”as well as 
					Embedded Systems development using microcontrollers and minimally
					 intrusive debugging techniques. 

					I recently got into web development, and I think 
					I'm in love. I built this website using a MERN stack, and am 
					currently working on some other web applications.
					When I'm not thinking of new websites to create 
					I spend time running or reading. Also, I'm a fan of crazy socks!
